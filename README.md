# GitHub Tracker

## Introduction

This app allows you to follow GitHub issues and keep a personal triage of important issues together with your notes.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to build the client code and `npm run watch` to build and watch for changes.

Run `node app` to run the server or `nodemon app` if [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) is installed.
